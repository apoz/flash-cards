## 5G architecture elements and 4G counterparts

The most significant changes between 5G and 4G are related to the original S-GW (Serving Gateway) and P-GW (PDN Gateway, or Packet Data Network Gateway) of the LTE core network, referred to as S/P-GW in their collocated form. Those elements are the 'motor' of the 4G core network as they deliver the data between LTE devices and other destinations.
In 5G, the tasks of those elements are divided into a separate user plane (UP) for the data connectivity via UPF (User Plane Function), and into a control plane (CP) for the signaling via SMF (Session Management Function).

Also, rather important change is made to Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) and Home Subscription Server (HSS) elements of 4G; they are located to the Authentication Server Function (AUSF) and Unified Data Management (UDM) in the 5G architecture model.

## Building blocks of 5G

eMBB (evolved mobile broadband)
massive machine type communications (mMTC)
ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC)

The eMBB, mMTC, and URLLC are the elemental building blocks, or "dimensions", of 5G as indicated in the ITU IMT- 2020 which sets the reference for the new era. (ITU-T, 2017).

### URLLC

This dimension provides the lowest latency values and serves thus well for fulfilling the needs of critical communications.

### mMTC

This dimension is designed to support a huge amount of simultaneously communicating Internet of Things (IoT) devices and applications.

### eMBB

This dimension provides very high data speeds clearly exceeding the 4G speeds.
