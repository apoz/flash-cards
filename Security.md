## Incident handling

### Incident handling overview

Incident handling is an action plan for dealing with the misuse of computer systems and networks, such as:
- Intrusions
- Malicious code infection
- Cyber-theft
- Denial of service
- Other security-related events

It's important to keep written procedures and policy in place so you know what to do when an incident occurs. Your incident handling plan should include hooks to your general Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity plans that deal with fire, floods, and other disastrous events.

The other key point of the definition is the notion of action. Sitting there watching is not incident handling.

Incident refers to actions that result in harm or the significant threat of harm to your computer systems or data. Looking for incidents involves finding deviations from the normal state of the network and systems. 

Events are observable, measurable occurrences our computer systems. Example of events include the system boot sequence, a system crash, packet flooding within a network.
Events must be recorded in notebooks and logs. Recording the same event in multiple places improve evidence.

Six step process:
- Preparation
- Identification
- Containment
- Eradication
- Recovery
- Lessons learned

### Incident handling process
#### Preparation

The goal of the Preparation phase is to get the team ready to handle incidents. 

##### People

The most easily attacked part of your organization:
- via targeted e-mails (spear phishing)
- via calls (social engineering)

You can regularly test you users with social-engineering calls and phishing tests:
- CallerID spoofing
- Phishing frameworks such as sptoolkit and Phishme

##### Policy - warning banners

Establish policy and warning banners advising:
- Access to the system is limited to company-authorized activity
- Any unauthorized access is prohibited
- Unauthorized users may face criminal or civil penalties
- The use of the system may be monitored and recorded

Legal team should review this banner.
Be careful of local privacy laws. Specially in Europe.

##### Policy - Response strategies

Establish an organization approach to incident handling.
Decide generally how you will handle the 'big issues' up front:
  - Maintain secrecy or notify law enforcement
  - Contain and clear or watch and learn
Get management buy-in and singoff your default practices.
